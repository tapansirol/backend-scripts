# IBM UrbanCode Deploy - Helm Chart

[IBM UrbanCode Deploy](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/products/urbancode-deploy/) is a tool for automating application deployments through your environments. It is designed to facilitate rapid feedback and continuous delivery in agile development while providing the audit trails, versioning and approvals needed in production.

## Introduction

This chart deploys a single server instance of IBM UrbanCode Deploy that may be scaled to multiple instances.

## Chart Details
* Includes a StatefulSet workload object
* A Service

## Prerequisites

1. Database - IBM UrbanCode Deploy requires a database.  The database may be running in your cluster or outside of your cluster.  This database  must be configured as described in [Installing the server database](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_7.0.0/com.ibm.udeploy.install.doc/topics/DBinstall.html) before installing this Helm chart.  The database parameters used to connect to the database are required properties of this Helm chart.  The Apache Derby database type is not supported when running the IBM UrbanCode Deploy server in a Kubernetes cluster.

2. JDBC drivers - A PersistentVolume (PV) that contains the JDBC driver(s) required to connect to the database configured above must be created.  You must either:

  * Create Persistence Stoarage Volume - Create a PV, copy the JDBC drivers to the PV, and create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that is bound to the PV. For more information on Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes). Sample YAML to create the PV and PVC are provided below.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: ucd-ext-lib
  labels:
    volume: ucd-ext-lib-vol
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  nfs:
    server: 192.168.1.17
    path: /volume1/k8/ucd-ext-lib
---
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ucd-ext-lib-volc
spec:
  storageClassName: ""
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      volume: ucd-ext-lib-vol
```
  * Dynamic Volume Provisioning - If your cluster supports [dynamic volume provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/), you may use it to create the PV and PVC. However, the JDBC drivers will still need to be copied to the PV. To copy the JDBC drivers to your PV during the chart installation process, first write a bash script that copies the JDBC drivers from a location accessible from your cluster to `${UCD_HOME}/ext_lib/`. Next, store the script, named `script.sh`, in a yaml file describing a [ConfigMap] (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/).  Finally, create the ConfigMap in your cluster by running a command such as `kubectl create configmap <map-name> <data-source>`.  Below is an example ConfigMap yaml file that copies a MySQL .jar file from a web server using wget.

```
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: user-script
data:
  script.sh: |
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Running script.sh..."
    if [ ! -f ${UCD_HOME}/ext_lib/mysql-jdbc.jar ] ; then
      echo "Copying file(s)..."    
      wget http://hostname/ucd-extlib/mysql-jdbc.jar
      mv mysql-jdbc.jar ${UCD_HOME}/ext_lib/
      echo "Done copying."
    else
      echo "File ${UCD_HOME}/ext_lib/mysql-jdbc.jar already exists."
    fi
```
Note the script must be named `script.sh`.

Additionally, you may manually create a PersistentVolume/PersistentVolumeClaim and use a script contained in a ConfigMap to copy drivers into the PersistentVolume.

3. A PersistentVolume that will hold the appdata directory for the UrbanCode Deploy server is required.  If your cluster supports dynamic volume provisioning you will not need to create a PersistentVolume (PV) or PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) before installing this chart.  If your cluster does not support dynamic volume provisioing, you will need to either ensure a PV is available or you will need to create one before installing this chart.  You can optionally create the PVC to bind it to a specific PV, or you can let the chart create a PVC and bind to any available PV that meets the required size and storage class.  Sample YAML to create the PV and PVC are provided below.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: ucd-appdata-vol
  labels:
    volume: ucd-appdata-vol
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 20Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  nfs:
    server: 192.168.1.17
    path: /volume1/k8/ucd-appdata
---
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ucd-appdata-volc
spec:
  storageClassName: ""
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      volume: ucd-appdata-vol
```

### PodSecurityPolicy Requirements

This chart requires a PodSecurityPolicy to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. Choose either a predefined PodSecurityPolicy or have your cluster administrator create a custom PodSecurityPolicy for you.

The predefined PodSecurityPolicy name: [`ibm-restricted-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp) has been verified for this chart, if your target namespace is bound to this PodSecurityPolicy you can proceed to install the chart. The predefined PodSecurityPolicy definitions can be viewed [here](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak/blob/master/spec/security/psp/README.md).

This chart also defines a custom PodSecurityPolicy which can be used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart. You can enable this custom PodSecurityPolicy using the ICP user interface or the supplied instructions/scripts in the pak_extension pre-install directory.

* From the user interface, you can copy and paste the following snippets to enable the custom PodSecurityPolicy
  * Custom PodSecurityPolicy definition:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: PodSecurityPolicy
    metadata:
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/description: "This policy is based on the most restrictive policy,
        requiring pods to run with a non-root UID, and preventing pods from accessing the host."
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: docker/default
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: docker/default
      name: ibm-ucd-prod-psp
    spec:

      - configMap
      - emptyDir
      - projected
      - secret
      - downwardAPI
      - persistentVolumeClaim
    ```
  * Custom ClusterRole for the custom PodSecurityPolicy:
    ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      name: ibm-ucd-prod-clusterrole
    rules:
    - apiGroups:
      - extensions
      resourceNames:
      - ibm-ucd-prod-psp
      resources:
      - podsecuritypolicies
      verbs:
      - use
    ```
  * RoleBinding for all service accounts in the current namespace. Replace `{{ NAMESPACE }}` in the template with the actual namespace.
    ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: ibm-ucd-prod-rolebinding
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: ibm-ucd-prod-clusterrole
    subjects:
    - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: Group
      name: system:serviceaccounts:{{ NAMESPACE }}
    ```
* From the command line, you can run the setup scripts included under pak_extensions.

  As a cluster administrator, the pre-install scripts and instructions are located at:
  * pre-install/clusterAdministration/createSecurityClusterPrereqs.sh

  As team admin/operator the namespace scoped scripts and instructions are located at:
  * pre-install/namespaceAdministration/createSecurityNamespacePrereqs.sh


## Resources Required
Kubernetes 1.9

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-ucd-release` and connect to the specified database:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-ucd-release --set database.type=<Database Type> --set database.name=<Database name> --set database.hostname=<Database hostname or IP> --set database.port=<Database port> --set database.username=<Database user> --set database.password=<Database passwd> ibm-ucd-prod
```
The above command sets database parameters. Other parameters may also be required. If parameters aren't specifed with the `--set` flag, their values will default to the values specified in the values.yaml file.

The [configuration](#Configuration) section lists the parameters that can be set during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Verifying the Chart
See NOTES.txt associated with this chart for verification instructions

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-ucd-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete --purge my-ucd-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
